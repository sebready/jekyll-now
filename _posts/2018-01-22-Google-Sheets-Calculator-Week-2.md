Google Sheets Calculator Week 2

In this lesson I made a whole new part of the calculator:

This part of the calculator will allow the shopkeeper to do so much more with working out the price. Firstly I added a stock and sold column that will allow the shopkeeper to see how many of those items he has. Then also show him how many of that item he has sold to customers. Then I made an unsold column which allowed the shopkeeper to see how many of those items he has left. After I created an expenditure column which shows how much money the unsold items cost all together. Then I made a price column which shows the shopkeeper how much he is selling the items for (more than original price because he wants to make profit). And then I made a profit column which shows the shopkeeper how much money he has earnt all together.
