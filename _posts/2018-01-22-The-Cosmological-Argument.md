"Nothing can come from nothing"

*St Thomas Aquinas*

Aquinas argues that all around us we can see that things are in motion or changing.

They are caused to move or change by something else.

Nothing comes from nothing : therefore there must have been something which started off the whole chain. This something is God.

God is the first cause.

Therefore there has robe a start to the chain.

He decided that no one made God, he just exists.

We can't have infinite regression
