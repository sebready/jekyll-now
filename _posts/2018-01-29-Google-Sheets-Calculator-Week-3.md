Google Sheets Calculator Week 3

In this lesson I made another new part of the calculator So the shopkeeper can add employees.

This allows the shopkeeper to add employees, the hours a week they work and the amount they get paid per hour. Then if the shopkeeper does have employees then the calculator will show him what his final amount of profit is - the amount he has to pay each employee.

As you can see the shopkeeper is earning minimum wage a week and the employees are are earning more than the shopkeeper!
