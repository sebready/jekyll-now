Google Sheets Code Making Week 1

 

This week we started a new topic of making our own code language and deciphering the code we made.

Firstly we made a column of all the original letters from a to z. Next we created a column showing what each of those letters will change to.

After that we moved to the deciphering stage. First we made a row for the original text with a drop down menu to select all of the different original letters. Then we made another row to show the person in google sheets what those letters will be once encrypted / coded.
