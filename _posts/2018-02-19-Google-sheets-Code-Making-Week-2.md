Google sheets Code Making Week 2

This lesson at the start i finished off my own google sheets code maker by adding a deciphering row to decipher the code from the table in my google sheets. Then I made another row that will make a normal sentence encrypted into the code that I have in the column.

Then after that we got started on another different project with binary.

This will decipher binary in numbers or words and also encrypt normal words or numbers into binary in weeks to come.
