Python With Turtle Week 1

This week at the start of the lesson we started a new topic of coding called python (with turtle)

This is the standard coding to get the turtle to move and draw shapes for you. You can customise the length of the sides and the angle at which the turtle moves at.

Then in the final few moments in the lesson we were allowed to play around with the turtle and try and make the coolest shapes we can.
