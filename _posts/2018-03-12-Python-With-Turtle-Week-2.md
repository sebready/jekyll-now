Python With Turtle Week 2

This week we did some more Python with turtle however this week we started to do more advanced shapes rather that squares and circles. 

In the lesson we some different things such as making letters (our initials) and how to not lay down a line while the turtle was moving. We also learnt how to properly code the turtle to make shapes and objects by using the commands forward, backward, left and right.

These two images show the commands for the letters and the letters themselves.
