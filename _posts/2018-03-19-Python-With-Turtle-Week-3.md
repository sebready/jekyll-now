Python With Turtle Week 3

This lesson we continued making our own letters but this time we created our own 3D letters. Also in the lesson I learnt how to fill letters starting it and stopping it. 

This exercise was very hard and I had to trial and error in some cases but in the end it worked out fine here are the end results of my letters and coding all together over the weeks.
